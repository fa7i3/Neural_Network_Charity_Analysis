### Data Preprocessing
### Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model 
My neural network model had 2 hidden layers and one output layer. My first hidden layer had 8 neurons and the second hidden layer had 5 layers. The first and second hidden layers have the activation function "relu" and "sigmoid" actication function for the output layer. 

Was the model able to achieve the target model performance?
* My neural network model had an accuracy of 73% and wasn't able to reach the target accuracy of 75%.


### Model Optimization
Three attempts taken to increase the model performance are:
* Attempt 1:
* Attempt 2:
* Attempt 3:

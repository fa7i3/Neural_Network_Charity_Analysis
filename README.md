### Data Preprocessing
### Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model 
My neural network model had 2 hidden layers and an output layer. My first hidden layer had 8 neurons and the second hidden layer had 5 layers. The first and second hidden layers have the activation function "relu" and "sigmoid" actication function for the output layer. 

Was the model able to achieve the target model performance?
* My neural network model had an accuracy of 73% and wasn't able to reach the target accuracy of 75%.


### Model Optimization
Three attempts taken to increase the model performance are:
* Attempt 1: Dropped an additional non-beneficial column that is the 'USE_CASE' column and the other columns stayed the same.
I used the same number of hidden layers and neurons (i.e. first hidden layer with 8 neurons and second hidden layer with 5 neurons) and an output layer. The accuracy of the model stayed at 73%.
* Attempt 2: To optimize the neural netowkr model, I added an extra hidden layer, and additional neurons was added to all hidden layers (i.e. hidden layer 1=100 nuerons, hidden layer 2 = 50 neurons and hidden layer 3 = 20 neurons). However, the accuracy stayed the same at 73%. 
* Attempt 3:
